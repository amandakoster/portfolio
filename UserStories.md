## Portfolio User Stories: MVP


* As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, showcase various case studies and project, clearly represent my passion for front end web dev, UX and UI, highlight my past carer as it relates to dev work

* As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.

* As a developer, I want wireframes for each of the main views in my portfolio, so that I can convey my knowledge of design and UX.

* As a developer, I want to make a data model (object constructor) for my portfolio data, so that I can create a pattern for all of my work and push data to the DOM vs. disrupting raw data and coding everyone line by line.

* As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned. 

* As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.

* As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.

* As a visitor I want the contact info to be very clear, and I want to be able to navigate to my various social media and repositories with ease.
